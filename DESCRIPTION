Description: Maximum entropy density based dependent data bootstrap. 
  An algorithm is provided to create a population of time series (ensemble) 
  without assuming stationarity. The reference paper (Vinod, H.D., 2004) explains
  how the algorithm satisfies the ergodic theorem and the central limit theorem.
